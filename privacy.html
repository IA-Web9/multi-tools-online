            <p>We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:</p>

            <h3>Service Provision</h3>
            <p>We use your information to provide, maintain, and improve our services. This includes processing your tool requests, delivering results, and ensuring that our tools function correctly. Most of our tools operate entirely in your browser, meaning your data is processed locally on your device and never sent to our servers.</p>

            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p>We may use your contact information to respond to your inquiries, provide customer support, send important updates about our services, and communicate with you about your account or transactions. We will only send you marketing communications if you have opted in to receive them, and you can opt out at any time.</p>

            <h3>Analytics and Improvement</h3>
            <p>We use automatically collected information to analyze how users interact with our platform, identify trends, understand user preferences, and improve our services. This helps us enhance user experience, fix bugs, and develop new features that meet user needs.</p>

            <h3>Security and Fraud Prevention</h3>
            <p>We use information to detect, prevent, and address technical issues, security threats, fraud, and other malicious activities. This helps us protect our platform, our users, and maintain a safe environment for everyone.</p>

            <h3>Legal Compliance</h3>
            <p>We may use your information to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or governmental requests. We may also use information to enforce our terms of service, protect our rights, and resolve disputes.</p>

            <h2>Data Processing and Storage</h2>
            <p>Most of our tools are designed to process data entirely in your browser, which means your data never leaves your device. This provides an additional layer of privacy and security, as your information is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

            <p>For tools that require server-side processing, we implement appropriate security measures to protect your data during transmission and storage. We use encryption, secure connections, and other industry-standard security practices to safeguard your information.</p>

            <p>We retain your information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. When we no longer need your information, we securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

            <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information only in the following circumstances:</p>

            <h3>Service Providers</h3>
            <p>We may share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as hosting, analytics, advertising, and customer support. These service providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes we specify.</p>

            <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
            <p>We may disclose your information if required by law, court order, or governmental regulation, or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>

            <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
            <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>

            <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
            <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect and store information about your preferences and how you use our website. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device when you visit our website.</p>
